More information at the project page:

DEPENDENCIES
===============
- Django >= 1.0 (http://djangoproject.com) - It WON'T Work with old releases
- A Python interface to a database (python-pysqlite, python-mysqldb, python-pgsql)
- Pygments >= 1.0 (http://pygments.org)
- Django-honeypot => 0.1.2 (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-honeypot/)
- A working SMTP server, either local or remote (i.e.: smtp.gmail.com)


CONFIGURATION
===============
For configuring BD-incollo, you have to edit two files:

- settings.py
Change all the variable values according to your desires. In particular:
    HONEYPOT_FIELD_NAME, use a realistic name like "phonenumber"
    MAX_PASTES_FOR_LATEST_PASTES_SECTION, the number of Pastes showed in the "Latest Pastes" section
    MAX_PASTES_REMEMBERED_PER_USER, the number of pastes remembered for each user
    
- set a valid username for a valid smtp server (EMAIL_HOST, EMAIL_HOST_USER etc.)
- set all the other usual Django settings values


The rest is up to you and Django! Install the models with
python manage.py syncdb

And decide how to serve it on your web server!
